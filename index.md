#### Prov Python

Prov Python is a python library for W3C Provenance Data Model supporting PROV-O (RDF), PROV-XML, PROV-JSON import/export.

For more information see: https://prov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
            
#### ProvToolbox

ProvToolbox is a Java library to create Java representations of PROV-DM, and convert them between RDF, PROV-XML, PROV-N, and PROV-JSON.

For more information see: https://lucmoreau.github.io/ProvToolbox/

#### PROV-template

A provenance template is a PROV document, describing the provenance that it is intended to be generated. A provenance template can be seen as a declarative specification of the provenance intended to be generated by an application.
For more information see: https://lucmoreau.wordpress.com/2017/03/30/prov-template-a-quick-start/

During the former project ENVRI+, a catalogue of PROV-templates has been implemented. The work is currently on hold and should resume this year.
More information here: https://github.com/EnvriPlus-PROV/ProvTemplateCatalog

#### ACTRIS demonstration

A demonstration developed by Markus Stocker is applying the PROV-O model to a simple ACTRIS data workflow. It is based on the graphical representation of the workflow described in the ACTRIS DMP: https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f1594ef10cf861aa559dcd116dcd361ec1f1a2df/68747470733a2f2f666f6c6b2e6e696c752e6e6f2f7e6d61726b75732f4143545249532d444d502f32303139303432342532304143545249532532304542415325323044617461253230466c6f7763686172742e706e67

The code executes the following actions:
    • Declaration of the vocabularies used to define the activities
    • Definition of the entities (i.e. datasets)
    • Definition of the agents
    • Definition of the activities
    • Definition of the links between them
    • Creation of the provenance file in RDF (ttl format) and plotting as a graph

The demonstration has been developed in Python and is available on a Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/envri-fair/provenance/blob/master/demonstrator.ipynb

#### SIOS demonstration

A demonstration developed by Lara Ferrighi is applying the netCDF-LD approach to generate RDF from netCDF files. This is used on a simple datafile provided through the SIOS webportal and generating netCDF-LD information in the data files.

The code execute the following actions:
    • Convert netCDF header to html page
    • Convert netCDF to netCDF+netCDF-LD header
    • Convert netCDF+netCDF-LD to RDF

The demonstration has been developed in Python and is available on a Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/ferrighi/netcdf-ld-prototype

#### IAGOS demonstration

A demonstration developed by Damien Boulanger is applying the PROV-O model to a simple IAGOS data workflow.

The code executes the following actions:
    • Declaration of the vocabularies used to define the activities
    • Definition of the entities (i.e. datasets)
    • Definition of the agents
    • Definition of the activities
    • Definition of the links between them
    • Creation of the provenance file in RDF (ttl format)

The demonstration has been developed in Java and is available here: https://github.com/damienboulanger/iagos-prov
